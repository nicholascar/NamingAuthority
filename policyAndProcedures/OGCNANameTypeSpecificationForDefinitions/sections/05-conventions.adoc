== Conventions

This document uses the normative terms (SHALL, SHOULD, etc) defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r3], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2: Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word 'shall' (not 'must') is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to comply with this specification.

Name production rules in this document are expressed using ABNF (IETF RFC 5324).
