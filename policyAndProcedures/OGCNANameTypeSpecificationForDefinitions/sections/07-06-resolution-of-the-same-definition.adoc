=== Resolution of the Same Definition to Different Encodings

The definition of a resource may be accessed in any number of encodings that are supported by a resolution service or resolver. A non-exhaustive list of example encodings relevant to different resources is below:

* Geography Markup Language (GML): Supports the encoding on features, coordinate reference systems, and codelists.
* Well Known Text (WKT): Supports the encoding on features, and coordinate reference systems.
* Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) in Resource Description Framework (RDF): Supports the encoding concepts, glossaries, and thesauri

A resolution service and a client application shall negotiate the encoding format to use through the content negotiation process defined in https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt[IETF RFC 7231].
