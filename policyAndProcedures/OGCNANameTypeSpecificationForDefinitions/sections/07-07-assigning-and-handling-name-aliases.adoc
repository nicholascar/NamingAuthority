=== Assigning and Handling Name Aliases

Where the URI of a named resource has an alias, the OGC-NA shall entail copies of all the properties for both forms of URI, and create inverse https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def[sameAs] relationships. For example, upon registering the resource `example-B` as an alias of `example-A`,

* all of the properties of  `example-A` shall be copied to `example-B`
* the statement that `example-B` is sameAs `example-A` shall be declared
* the statement that `example-A` is sameAs `example-B` shall be declared

In code, this is illustrated below.
