=== Supporting Services

In some cases, additional services may be provided by OGC Staff to facilitate the use of names or URIs that are registered with the OGC-NA. Such supporting services may be provided through a path underneath http://www.opengis.net/def or its sub-paths. The interface definition and syntax for communicating with the supporting services is *out-of-scope* of the responsibilities of the OGC-NA.

Examples of such supporting services include:

* AUTO2 namespace for CRS: The "AUTO2" namespace is used for "automatic" coordinate reference systems; that is, for a class of CRSs that include a user-selected centre of projection. See section 6.7.3.4 of the Web Map Service (WMS) version 1.3.0 standard (OGC 06-042). Note that although the namespace is with the OGC-NA http://www.opengis.net/def/auth/auto2[here], the syntax is instead specified in the WMS 1.3.0 standard.
* AUTO namespace for CRS: The AUTO namespace is used for "automatic" projections; that is, for a class of projections that include an arbitrary center of projection. See section 6.5.5.2 of the WMS 1.1.1 standard (OGC 01-068r3). Note that although the namespace is with the OGC-NA http://www.opengis.net/def/auth/auto[here], the syntax is instead specified in the WMS 1.1.1 standard. The supporting service is provided at http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/AUTO
* Compound CRS: See clause 6.4 of the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema with Corrigendum Standard version 1.1.1 (OGC 09-146r8). Note that although the service is provided through the OGC Definitions Server, the syntax and interface are specified in the CIS 1.1.1 standard. The supporting service is provided at http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound
